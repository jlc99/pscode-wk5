// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

When given input of two numbers, x and y:
- add "x + y"
- return sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

When given any number, n:
- divide n/2
- IF remainder == 0, return "EVEN"
- IF remainder != 0, return "ODD"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

When given five numbers, a, b, c, x, and y:
- add all numbers: a + b + c + x + y
- return SUM
- divide SUM/5
- return dividend as AVERAGE
- check all numbers, a, b, c, x, and y, against one another for greater than and less than
- return number with no other less than as MINIMUM
- return number with no other greater than as MAXIMUM
